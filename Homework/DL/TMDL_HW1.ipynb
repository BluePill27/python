    "**The task.** Design a ReLU network with fewer than 10000 connections that approximates the function $f(x)=\\sin x$ on the segment $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ with uniform error not greater than $10^{-12}$. Implement the network in a Python notebook. Count the number of connections and demonstrate that the error bound is satisfied."
